MASSAGE TO DAISY (from Sal):
Good job on the hard work you did, but some things should be pointed out:

1.  doing stuff like margin-top: -450px; is VERY BAD for our code.
    margin-top: -450px; WILL LOOK HORRIBLE WHEN SCREEN IS RESIZED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Use containers instead and only use margins inside containers and below like 100px or somn
    Places that have this issue: 'login.html', 'index.html', 'register.html'

2.  it's bad practice to only show requirements for password when clicked! if someone is using a phone or touch screen
    they might never see the requirements. this also casuses a big mess with hideRequirements() showRequirements() functions. 
    I recommend having something small under password that says what the issue is, but I'll leave that to you to work on!

3.  Let's try to NOT have Frontend-updating-functions inside code.js we have other js files we can use for that.
    & make sure to import the js file next time or your js may not always work. 

4.  Professor Leinecker said in class to NOT use "alert()" functions in JS!!!!!!!!!!
