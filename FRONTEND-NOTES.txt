General To-Do: 

Nav Bar: 
- Fix hover functionality

Home Page:

- Using center makes VS-code color it in red, weird color :/

Login:
- Form field validation
- Regex email validation??
- What do we do when the user clicks on forgot password

Register: 
- What do we do when the user clicks on register
