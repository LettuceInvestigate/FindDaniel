General To-Do: 
- sizing adjestment needed between high-low: buttons overflow to next line (small error within 10px)

Nav Bar: 
- Make the logo bigger 
- resize text
- Fix hover functionality

Home Page: 
- Add people images at some point (potentially with our faces)

Our Tragedy:
- normal page size: middle box does not extend to all of text
- Page minimized makes text appear below everything & doesn't resize image or middle gray box.
