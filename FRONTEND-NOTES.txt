General To-Do: 
- Sizing adjestment needed between high-low: buttons overflow to next line (small error within 10px)

Nav Bar: 
- Make the logo bigger 
- Resize text
- Fix hover functionality

Home Page: 
- Add people images at some point (potentially with our faces)

Our Tragedy:
- Normal page size: middle box does not extend to all of text
- Page minimized makes text appear below everything & doesn't resize image or middle gray box.
- Using center makes VS-code color it in red, weird color :/

Login:
- Form field validation
- Regex email validation??
- What do we do when the user clicks on forgot password
